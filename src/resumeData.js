  bioDescription: "My name is Zachary Nemeroff, and I'm an enthusiastic JavaScript developer passionate about test driven development and object-oriented programming using agile workflow processes. I love to build responsive and accessible apps using REST APIs with modern tools including JavaScript, TypeScript, Vue.js, React, HTML5, CSS3, and jQuery to name a few (<skillsLink>). I'm constantly seeking opportunities calling for creative solutions, so I may expand my knowledge and grow technical skills outside of my comfort zone. If you're up for a challenge, try the Mr. Simon game I created below!",
